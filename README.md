# Bisection-method

This is the implementation of numerical optimization method called Bisection Method.

The Bisection Method is used to find the root of the function. In the file source file there is a function called 'func'. For this 'func' you have to write your own function that needs to be analyzed. Moreover, for Bisection Method, we need to indicate the region, consequently you have to set your own values for 'x_lower' and 'x_upper'.
